                          MARTINSVILLE – Debra Buchanan grew up around antiques. Her parents adored items from a bygone era, which fostered the Horsepasture antique store owner’s love of old things.The local expert held an interactive session where she asked audience members about their dolls and why they collect.

                        <h1>Toy-collecting couple in Towson in search of dolls, trains and treasures of the past</h1>
                        <div id="newsimg2"></div>
                        <p>The couple, from Tampa, Fla., travel all over the country in search of valuable antiques, mostly toys, but occasionally odd items that pique their interest. They once had a brick and mortar store in Florida and organized a large toy show, but now exclusively sell items online. That’s where most buyers go, as they do with much of retail, they said.
                        These days, the most sought after toys tend to be from the 1970s and earlier, Laura Zalkin said. Many baby boomer and Generation X buyers are looking to fulfill their childhood dreams, on the hunt for Hot Wheels cars with a red stripe on the wheel from the 1960s, G.I. Joe action figures, early Barbie dolls and Star Wars items (from the first three movies, she said). Determining what’s valuable can be tricky. Not all old Barbie dolls are highly sought after. Laura Zalkin said that a telltale sign of an authentic early Barbie are the copper wire tubes in her feet which originally connected to a stand that came with the doll. But even if you have such a collectible, the condition of the toy is very important. The more love it had as a toy, the less it might be worth now. “We can always tell which was the favorite” based on the wear and tear, she said. Then, there are reproductions that don’t hold any value for collectors.</p>
